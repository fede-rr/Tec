    <h2>1. A Childhood Full of Imagination</h2>
    <p>
      Since I was a little kid, I’ve always loved performing, dancing around the house, and using my imagination.
      Some of my earliest memories are filled with singing in front of the mirror and creating small shows for my family.
      Even before I knew what musical theatre was, I was already living it in my own way.

    <h2>2. Discovering My Passion</h2>
    <p>
      As I grew older, I discovered my true passion: musical theatre. It all started when I saw my first play at school and
      immediately fell in love with the stage. I began joining school productions and taking every opportunity to perform.
      Acting, singing, and dancing made me feel more alive than anything else. This passion gave me confidence and a sense
      of direction, and I’ve been following it ever since.

    <h2>3. Growing and Performing</h2>
    <p>
      Today, I’ve made great progress — from performing in small school plays to taking on bigger roles. I continue to train,
      learn, and improve. Musical theatre brings me joy, creativity, and unforgettable experiences. It’s not just something I do —
      it’s a part of who I am.
