        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I was born on September 8, 2011. My mom’s name is Alejandra and my dad’s name is Octavio. They both work and take care of a hospital. I have an older sister named Ximena. She is 18 years old.</p>
        <p>When I was little, I went skiing on the snow. I used to get mad for no reason. My first school was The Churchill School. One of my best memories is when I won my first football tournament at 6 years old. I was a sweet kid, but I was often angry.</p>
        <p>Things I liked: skiing, football, having fun. Things I disliked: getting frustrated easily. My hobbies were mostly sports and playing.</p>

        <h2>Body</h2>
        <p>As I got older, I started doing more sports, especially football. Primary and secondary changed my life because I learned new things, made friends, and grew as a person.</p>
        <p>Before school, I was more playful and less focused. Now I am more serious about my goals and hobbies.</p>
        <p>Things I didn’t like when I was younger: reading and writing. Now I like working hard, playing sports, and learning new things.</p>
        <p>Currently, I enjoy football and setting goals. My hobbies now include sports and learning about business. I dislike wasting time or giving up easily.</p>

        <h2>Final</h2>
        <p>In the future, I want to go to high school for one year in Canada at BCS. After that, I want to study business in Mexico and live in Switzerland.</p>
